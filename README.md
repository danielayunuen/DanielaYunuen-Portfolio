# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This portfolio showcases a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills as a data analyst, utilizing a variety of tools and technologies to effectively analyze, clean, and visualize data.

## Featured Projects

### Analysis of Coffee Shop Data in Excel
In this project, I analyzed data from a café store using Microsoft Excel. I performed data cleaning, consolidation, and analysis using pivot tables and charts. Additionally, I implemented advanced functions such as VLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH to gather detailed insights into the store's performance. The project culminates in the creation of an interactive dashboard to visualize the insights obtained.

### Tableau Dashboard for House Sales
I developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau that presents detailed data on house sales in King County. This project provides a clear and concise visualization of real estate market trends, allowing for easy interpretation of the data.

### Walmart Store Sales Analysis with MySQL
Using MySQL, I analyzed sales data from 45 Walmart stores in three different cities. I implemented advanced queries, including GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, CASE, and DISTINCT, to extract relevant information about store performance and sales trends.

### Exploratory Data Analysis with Python: Roller Coasters
In this project, I utilized Python to analyze data related to roller coasters. I performed data cleaning, visualization, and exploration tasks, using charts to identify patterns and trends in roller coaster data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis with Python: Movies
In this project, I used Python to analyze data related to movies. I performed data cleaning, visualization, and exploration tasks, exploring correlations between various variables and the profits generated by each movie.
